Here are the next tasks listed, as a TODO list:


## TODO list for the current version
* @RelayConnection error when applied on a list: https://github.com/graphql-java-generator/graphql-maven-plugin-project/issues/62
* Publish the Gradle 1.12 version
* Remove all log4j dependencies from the client and server pom dependencies (issue #52)
   Done. But still to be checked: Remove exclusions in poms, like spring-boot-starter-logging
* Issue 65: add some more info when someone a request like one of those:
    * "{id name subObject(types: [TYPE1, TYPE2])}"   (the list should be an input parameter)
    * "{id name subObject(type: {some json})}"       (the json should be an input parameter)
* Remove the SubscriptionClientWebSocket class
* Check subscription against the Hasura setup (answer to issue 54) : https://hasura.io/
* Check the client dependencies (from all client samples)
* Add unit test in runtime, to test the Reactive stuff
* Check the WebClient with a default TLS configuration on a well known server
* Update the README with the XxxxExecutor classes
* Make the Maven plugin generate its code in the graphql-maven-plugin folder (like the gradle plugin)
==> update the four tutorials
==> Check the documented default value
* Better document the BatchLoader (including the generateBatchLoaderEnvironment parameter)
* [WIP] Adding the relay connection capabilities (almost done, unit tests are Ok, remaining task: integration tests).
* Check the #0038 issue: how to update a OAuth token with a javax.ws.rs.client.Client 
	OAuth:"https://www.baeldung.com/jersey-sse-client-request-headers";//
	"https://www.baeldung.com/spring-webclient-oauth2#springsecurity-internals"//
	"https://manhtai.github.io/posts/spring-webclient-oauth2-client-credentials/"
* Switch to apache 2.0 licence
* Comments coming from the graphQL schema should be reported in the generated code, especially the POJOs and the queries, mutations and subscriptions
* Replace all the thrown RuntimeException by meaningfull exceptions
* Allow to control the list of schema files, and their order (necessary to properly manage the extend keyword)
* Add a description of the GraphQL mojo
* Waiting for [issue 2055](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/issues/2055) to be solved. Some test cases can then be run again (see the allGraphQLCases.graphqls file)
* Add the Tutorial for Subscription, on the Client side
* Analyze and response to issue #39 (@connection for relay)
* Do a sample project based on the github GraphQL schema
* Specifying an unknown template in the pom should raise an error
* Allow to change the GraphQL server path (for query/mutation and for subscription)
* Change the JsonResponseWrapper as an interface, implemented by the XxxRootResponse classes
* Allow aliases for query/mutation fields
* [server side] Check graphql-java correction for issue 1844 (Directive values of type 'EnumValue' are not supported yet), waiting for graphql-java v16 release
* enum values may currently not be a java keyword (seems to be a graphql-java limitation). issue to raise in the graphql-java project
* Check compatibility with the schema.public.graphqls (available in the plugin logic test resources folder)
* Document generateJPAAnnotation 
* Stop generating SubscriptionTypeResponse and SubscriptionTypeRootResponse ?

## TODO List for 2.0 version:
* Remove the query/mutation/subscription Response type (currently deprecated)
* copyRuntimeSources: false should be the default value (change to be done in the tutorial and the client-dependency)
* separateUtilityClasses: true should be the default value
* Add a generateDeprecatedRequestResponse plugin parameter. Default value to true (no more XxxxResponse would be generated). With a value of true, the XxxxResponse would still be generated for compatibility with old code.

Hello,

  You can try one of the com.graphql-java-generator maven or gradle plugins.
They generates the POJOs and utility classes from the GraphQL schema, to let you execute GraphQL request from your java code:

https://github.com/graphql-java-generator/graphql-maven-plugin-project

https://github.com/graphql-java-generator/graphql-gradle-plugin-project

FYI, these plugins also have a server mode, to help developing GraphQL servers, in Java.
